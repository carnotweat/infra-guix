If youâ€™re using Intel processor, then make sure your processor has support for hardware virtualization. 
If it does, then make sure VT-x or VT-d extension is enabled from the BIOS of your computer

packages:  virt-manager

Indeed, it was disabled in the BIOS, after I enabled virtualisation,
/dev/kvm appeared.
