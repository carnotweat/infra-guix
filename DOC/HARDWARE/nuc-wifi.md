guix package: rtl8812au-aircrack-ng-linux-module [this is is my usb wifi card]
location: gnu/packages/linux.scm
https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au
The TP-LINK Archer T4U is a dual band 802.11ac USB adapter.
Linux driver for Realtek USB wireless network adapters
This is Realtek's rtl8812au Linux driver for USB 802.11n wireless
network adapters, modified by the aircrack-ng project to support monitor mode
and frame injection.  It provides a @code{88XXau} kernel module that supports
RTL8812AU, RTL8821AU, and RTL8814AU chips.

wpa_supplicant -c home/wifi.conf -i wlp0s20f0u4 -B
sudo wpa_supplicant -c home/wifi.conf -i wlp0s20f0u4 -B

THIS WORKS:
wpa_supplicant -D nl80211 -i wlp0s20f0u4 -c home/wifi.conf

THIS DOES NOT WORK, OR DOES IT?
wpa_supplicant -D wext -i wlp0s20f0u4 -c home/wifi.conf

-B means run wpa_supplicant in the background.
-D specifies the wireless driver. wext is the generic driver.
-c specifies the path for the configuration file.

 2 wlan      phy0                unblocked unblocked
If the wlan interface is blocked, you can unblock it with sudo rfkill unblock wlan. You should run wpa_supplicant -c ... after you unblock the device.

Now try to get a IP address:

$ dhclient -v INTERFACE_NAME

;; NetworkManager and its applet.
         (service network-manager-service-type)
         (service wpa-supplicant-service-type)    ;needed by NetworkManager
         (simple-service 'network-manager-applet
                         profile-service-type
                         (list network-manager-applet)
First, run the following commands to unblock the wifi card, determine its device name, and connect using the device name you received from ifconfig -a. In my case itâ€™s wlp4s0 so I run the command like so:


rfkill unblock all
ifconfig -a
wpa_supplicant -c wifi.conf -i wlp4s0 -B
NOTE: If for any reason running wpa_supplicant fails, make sure to kill any background instances of it before trying to run it again because the old instances will block new runs from working. This wasted a couple hours of my time the first time I tried installing Guix!

The last step to set up networking is to run dhclient to turn on DNS for your wifi connection:

dhclient -v wlp4s0



rfkill list all
ifconfig -a
lsusb
ip a
lspci -k
 lshw -C network

===step 3. stop my usual networking services:=======
# herd stop networking
Service networking has been stopped.
# herd stop wpa-supplicant
Service wpa-supplicant has been stopped.


====step 4. run wi-fi through wi-fi usb adapter=======

# ifconfig wlp0s29u1u2 up

# dhclient -v wlp0s29u1u2

(wpa-supplicant-service-type config =>
                                                           
(wpa-supplicant-configuration
                                                            (interface 
"wlp0s29u1u2")
                                                            (config-file 
"/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf")))

I've added these additions to config.scm, thinking it will give effect:

(define %sudoers-specification
  (plain-file "sudoers" "root ALL=(ALL) ALL
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /wpa"))
....

(operating-system
...
                  (sudoers-file %sudoers-specification)
)

And reconfigured. And it works!

Note that must run it with sudo!

$ sudo /wpa isp

nmcli device wifi

Check the output of

        # herd status

"networking" and "wpa-supplicant" should be there.
You can use "nmcli" or "nmtui" to manage your connections

(cons*
>    (network-manager-service)
>    (wpa-supplicant-service)

You need to replace this last line with:

  (service wpa-supplicant-type wpa-supplicant)
