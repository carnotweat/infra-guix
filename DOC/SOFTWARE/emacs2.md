Spacemacs

Spacemacs already brings TypeScript support via its typescript layer. It basically sets up the tide mode (which also needs a few things set up like nodejs,etc..).

npm install -g eslint jshint csslint standard jscs js-beautify tern

The quality and the features vary wildly though â€“ some modes like SLIME, cc-mode, js2-mode and cperl-mode are nothing short of magical and others provide only basic highlighting and indentation support.

add javascript to the existing dotspacemacs-configuration-layers list in this file.
put in the bottom into user config: (setq tern-command '("node" "/home/hoertlehner/Documents/tern"))

Beautify Code

python
Emacs python-mode of course, which is the most fundamental tool to use
Pymacs is a beautiful library written to allow two way communications between elisp and python. It offers a method to extend emacs using python, and allows modules from either language to be loaded through the other. It comes in handy if you're the kind of person who's always wanted to extend emacs to do something, but never wanted to get into elisp.
Which brings me to Ropemacs - the Rope python refactoring library integrated into emacs that uses pymacs to do so. Excellent stuff.
yasnippet - a snippets library that allows for inplace expansion of code, and other goodness. Check out the python demo on Youtube, linked from the google code page for the project.
Of course, there's ECB - Emacs Code Browser, which I think is a bit superior to the vim equivalent that I've used (NERDTree).
There's git.el which will integrate git into your buffer, allowing for easy diffs, comparisons, commits et al. I think there's also psvn.el to do the same with SVN.
There's Autcomplete.el which allows for auto completion in any language
pyflakes - a lint like tool for Python
Jedi for autocompletion: Jedi - an awesome autocompletion library for Python.
If you enjoy writing tests I would suggest Nose (Installation and quick start) and nosetests.el. This is very cool because you can set up a keybinding to run the tests and outputs the results in a separate buffer so you never have to leave Emacs.
