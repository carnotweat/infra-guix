Monitors

Size

Studies clearly show that more desktop space means more productivity (goes up without saturation effect) Moving from a monitor that can display 2 A4 pages to one 4 or 6 pages makes sense.

It is nice to see an HDMI port included for compatibility purposes, even on the G-SYNC model, but be aware that to use G-SYNC or FreeSync (‘CK1’ model) or indeed the maximum refresh rate at the native resolution you need to be using the DisplayPort on a compatible GPU. 

The RRP of the ‘CK1’ (FreeSync) model is set at £899.99 and for the G-SYNC model £999.99 in the UK. The US RRP for the G-SYNC model is $1299 with the ‘1CK’ model expected to be somewhat lower.

HDMI
Version
features
1.3
2560x1600 at 75Hz at 24 bits/pixel, and 60Hz at 30 bits/pixel.
needs HiSpeed HDMI cable
1.4
4,096x2,160-pixel resolution up to 24 frames per second, or 
3,820x2,160 up to 30fps. 

If you've bought any gear with an HDMI connector in the past few years, it's probably version 1.4. 

HDMI interface used with (older) onboard Intel chips only supports 1920x1200


2.0
also known as as HML 
HDMI 2.0 tops out at 14.4 Gb/s (overhead removed).



DisplayPort
version
features
1.2
Right now DP 1.2 Tops out 17.28 Gb/s (with overhead removed)
120hz - 3440x1440x32(bit)x120(hz) = 19.02 Gb/s  so at 120 hz a uwqhd display cannot be sent data at 120 hz.  
1.3
4k und bis zu 120 Hz ist erst mit DP 1.3 drin. 

DP 1.3 is not even out and DP 1.3 ports are not included in ANY video cards out there. That's the big bummer when it comes down to it.
DisplayPort 1.3 (15. September 2014) mit 810 MHz Symbolrate
1 Leitung: 810 MByte/s (6,48 GBit/s): ausreichend für 2560×1600
2 Leitungen: 1620 MByte/s (12,96 GBit/s): ausreichend für 3840×2160
4 Leitungen: 3240 MByte/s (25,92 GBit/s): ausreichend für 5120×2880


1.4
DisplayPort 1.4 (1. März 2016) mit 1536 MHz Symbolrate[7]
1 Leitung: 1010 MByte/s (8,1 GBit/s): ausreichend für 2560×1600
4 Leitungen: 4050 MByte/s (32,4 GBit/s): ausreichend für 7680x4320





Refresh Rates (Hertz = frames per second)
Movies: 24 Herz 
60 Hz old monitors
75 Hz mainstream currently
smaller gaming monitors have 144 hz

Flicker Free (One can work longer , with less stress on the eyes)
Even modern monitors flicker, when the graphic card sends new images uncoordinated with the resync schedule of the monitor. In this case, sometimes e3 the monitor renders a half drawn image, and then continues with a new image -> this results in huge flicker, which is noticeable in games, but I believe subconsciously also when doing lots of work in front of the monitor.
Alternatives:
Nvidia GSync (needs displayport cables firmer standard than AMD; some people hate it; but looks like it is a little better)  GSYNC doubles or triples the frames if under 30 fps; therefore never flicker) G-SYNC does not work with any other standard than DisplayPort 1.2, so DisplayPort 1.3 or HDMI 2.0 (MHL) is not an option.
